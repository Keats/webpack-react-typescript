Introduced in the following articles: 

- <https://www.vincentprouillet.com/blog/react-typescript-webpack-1/>
- Not live yet: <https://www.vincentprouillet.com/blog/react-typescript-webpack-2/>

Using the repository as a base, you get a nice local development environment
as well as a reasonably optimized production build explained step by step. After 
reading both articles, you should have a reasonable understanding of Webpack allowing you
to customise the configuration however you see fit.
